# Task_Tracker
Design Choices:
  User has_many -> Tasks. Task has a fiedl that belongs_to user and user cannot be made without a name. Tasks need to have a name, description and time.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
